## AIM
To create a fashion trend identification and generation system using a combination of old vintage clothing collections and contemporary trends datasets. 
By integrating Gemini prompt engineering, CycleGAN (Generative Adversarial Network) technology and Stable diffusion models, our objective is to enable the model to re-envision historical fashion elements to seamlessly integrate into modern styles.
Additionally, we plan to incorporate user-generated clothing images to further enrich and train the model, facilitating innovative interpretations of vintage aesthetics within current fashion landscapes

## CycleGAN
We have trained a CycleGAN to transform images between the two styles (contemporary and vintage) and then extracting and integrating patterns to create visually cohesive outputs. These are some of the outputs our model generated after the training and application of Image Blending:
