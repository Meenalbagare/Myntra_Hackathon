## AIM
To create a fashion trend identification and generation system using a combination of old vintage clothing collections and contemporary trends datasets. 
By integrating Gemini prompt engineering, CycleGAN (Generative Adversarial Network) technology and Stable diffusion models, our objective is to enable the model to re-envision historical fashion elements to seamlessly integrate into modern styles.
Additionally, we plan to incorporate user-generated clothing images to further enrich and train the model, facilitating innovative interpretations of vintage aesthetics within current fashion landscapes
